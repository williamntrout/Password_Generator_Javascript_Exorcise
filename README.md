# Password_Generator_Javascript_Exorcise

With my submission, I attempted to build a password genrator that would work seamlessly with the boiler plate html provided by the program.  After several starts and stops, I was able to begin grasping the concepts of JavaScript enough to complete the assgnment.  Keeping it simple is definately the best approach.  All of the examples of password generators online, primarily the "simple" ones, seem to be created by someone that has very impressive skills.
With my submission, I made sure to organize my steps in a methodical fashion.  I decided to put steps and operations together as they happen rather then group them by type or action.  IE my confirmations are all together, my declarations are all together, and my prompts are all toghether.  In stead of adding a section for If/Else statements, I added them direacty under the prompts and alerts they were speaking to and about. 
I then made sure all of my actions were in order as they happen on screen. It made much more sense to me and allowed me to follow along and get one thing working before moving on to the next thing. 
I feel that my submission meets the criteria and welcome any feedback.
